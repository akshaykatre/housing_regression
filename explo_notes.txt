Alley
The overall effect should be minimal. Very few houses have alley. 

Round 1: Lets drop it 

Basement 

BsmtQual:  Evaluates the height of the basement
37 NA values 

BsmtCond: Evaluates the general condition of the basement
37 NA values

BsmtExposure: Refers to walkout or garden level walls
38 NA values

BsmtFinType1: Rating of basement finished area
37 NA values

BsmtFinSF1: Type 1 finished square feet
0 NA values. 
However, there are 467 with values 0, meaning that a 
large portion of them are unfinished

BsmtFinType2: Rating of basement finished area (if multiple types)
38 NA values 

So at the times the rating of the basement is missing, while the 
finished/ unfinished state is always known.

BsmtFinSF2: Type 2 finished square feet
0 NA values
1293 have finsihed sq. feet of second basement. 

Does this mean that 
there is no second basement? 


BsmtUnfSF: Unfinished square feet of basement area
0 NA values

TotalBsmtSF: Total square feet of basement area
0 NA values

BsmtFullBath: Basement full bathrooms
0 NA values

BsmtHalfBath: Basement half bathrooms
0 NA values
